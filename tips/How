I know HTTP keep-alive is on by default in HTTP 1.1 but I want to find a way to confirm that it is actually working.

Does anyone know of a simple way to test from a web browser (EG how to make sense of wireshark). I know I need to look for multiple HTTP requests over the same TCP connection but I don't know how to confirm that in wireshark or any other way.

Thanks!

As Ron Garrity said on ServerFault, you can use Curl like this:

curl -Iv http://www.aptivate.org 2>&1 | grep -i 'connection #0'

And it outputs these two lines if keep-alive is working:

* Connection #0 to host www.aptivate.org left intact
* Closing connection #0

And if keep-alive is not working, then it just outputs this line:

* Closing connection #0
